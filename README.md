# HandWrittenDigitRecognition_MNIST_DataSet_NeuralNetwork_Numpy
Hand Written Digit Recognition for MNIST DataSet using NeuralNetwork in Numpy


Build a complete neural network using Numpy. Implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.

 
Use the MNIST dataset to train model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.

Task is divided into the following sections:

- Data preparation
- Feedforward
- Loss computation
- Backpropagation
- Parameter updates
- Model training and predictions
